# `AI Safety Incident Log API`

This project provides a backend service for logging and managing AI safety incidents. The service allows users to log incidents with details such as title, description, severity, and timestamp, and supports basic CRUD operations.

---

## `Features`

- Log new incident
- Retrieve all incidents
- Retrieve a particular incident
- Delete a particular incident

---

## `Tech Stack`

- Node.js
- Express.js (Web Framework)
- TypeScript
- Prisma (ORM for PostgreSQL)
- PostgreSQL (Database)
- Zod (Schema validation)
- CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)

# `Setup Instructions`

1. **Clone the repository**

2. **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Environment Configuration**

- Create a `.env` file by copying the `.env.example` which is provided.
- Edit the `.env` file to set up your environment variables. Example:
    ```bash
    DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/incidents
    ```
- Replace `username` and `password` with your actual PostgreSQL credentials.

4. **Set up the Database**

- Ensure that your PostgreSQL database is running. Then, run:
    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev
    ```
- This will set up your database schema as defined in the Prisma schema.
- To inspect the database visually:
    ```bash
    npx prisma studio
    ```

5. **Build the Project**

- Before starting the server, you need to compile the TypeScript files:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
- This will create a `dist/` directory with the compiled JavaScript code.

6. **Seed the Database (Optional)**

- To pre-populate the database with some sample incidents:
    ```bash
    npm run seed
    ```

7. **Start the Server**

- After building the project, start the server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
- The server will be running at:  
  [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
